# Markdown

## MDX Syntax

MDX is a combination of Markdown and JSX, and regular Markdown syntax can be used for most formatting. What follows is a guide to the Markdown syntax supported by Gatsby. Each section gives the Markdown syntax, the HTML element it creates, and a demonstration of the element.

### Headings

Headings are usually created in Markdown with a set of hash (\#) characters placed before the text for the heading, with a space in between (this space is **required** in Gatsby). The number of hashes corresponds to the level of the heading (i.e., \# corresponds to a first-level heading, or the `<h1>` HTML tag).

| Markdown | HTML |
| -------- | ---- |
| `# Heading 1` | `<h1>Heading 1</h1>` |
| `## Heading 2` | `<h2>Heading 2</h2>` |
| `### Heading 3` | `<h3>Heading 3</h3>` |
| `#### Heading 4` | `<h4>Heading 4</h4>` |
| `##### Heading 5` | `<h5>Heading 5</h5>` |
| `###### Heading 6` | `<h6>Heading 6</h6>` |

There is alternative syntax for `<h1>` and `<h2>` headings:

| Markdown | HTML |
| -------- | ---- |
| `Heading 1` <br /> `===============` | `<h1>Heading 1</h1>` |
| `Heading 2` <br /> `---------------` | `<h2>Heading 2</h2>` |

### Emphasis

#### Italics

To mark text in *italics*, add an asterisk (\*) or underscore (\_) before and after the text to be formatted.

| Markdown | Alternative | HTML | Output |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| `*italics*` | `_italics_` | `<em>italics</em>` | *italics* |

#### Bold

To mark text in **boldface**, add two asterisks (\*\*) or two underscores (\_\_) before and after the text to be formatted.

| Markdown | Alternative | HTML | Output |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| `**boldface**` | `__boldface__` | `<strong>boldface</strong>` | **boldface** |

#### Bold and italics together

To emphasize text with ***both boldface and italics***, use three asterisks (\*\*\*) or three underscores (\_\_\_) before and after the text to be formatted.

| Markdown | Alternative | HTML | Output |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| `***boldface and italics***` | `___boldface and italics___` | `<strong><em>boldface</em></strong>` | ***boldface and italics*** |

> **Note**
> To emphasize text with bold or italics in the **middle** of a sentence, use asterisks but not underscores. For example, 

`middle **of** sentence` becomes middle **of** sentence, but

`middle_of_sentence` becomes middle_of_sentence.

The underscores only work when there is spacing before and after the emphasized word.

### Line breaks

To create a line break, follow a line with two spaces and then hit enter.
