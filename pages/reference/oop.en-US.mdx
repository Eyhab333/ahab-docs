# OOP

OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

## Principles/Concepts of OOP

### Encapsulation 

wrapping up of data and information under a single unit.

binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them.

### Abstraction

abstraction “displays” only the relevant attributes of objects and “hides” the unnecessary details.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is one in which a new class is created that inherits the properties of the already exist class. It supports the concept of code reusability and reduces the length of the code in object-oriented programming.

### Polymorphism 

word Ploy means "Many" and word Morphism means "Form" so it means "Many Forms", the ability to take more than one form.

We can achieve Polymorphism through:

- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading
- Overriding
- Virtual Methods

##  Interfaces: Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

A pure virtual function doesn't have the function body and it must end with = 0.

If you have one pure virtual function in a class then it will be converted to abstract class.
