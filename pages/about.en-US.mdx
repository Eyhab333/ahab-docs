# About me

After graduating with a bachelor degree in agriculture science, I decided to look for opportunities abroad.
But during the COVID-19 pandemic, I realized I needed to learn new skills. I made a list of three skills to try: E-marketing, design, and, reluctantly, programming. I thought programming was only for very smart people.

## The Beginning of My Learning Journey

In my free time, I started learning e-marketing. After a while I started with design, so I learned Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro.

## Embracing Programming

I began with Websites for teaching programming for children and the Google Grasshopper app, enjoying learning JavaScript. This led me to FreeCodeCamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also took a Front-End courses on https://elzero.org/ with Eng. Osama Elzero and practiced on a lot of small projects on Frontend Mentor Website.

I wanted a deeper understanding of computer science, so I took Harvard’s CS50 course and Crash Course Computer Science.

A big moment for me was finding Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud’s Programming Advices channel. His clear and detailed explanations kept me motivated to learn more about problem-solving, C++, data structures, algorithms, C#, the .NET Framework, and SQL for database management. I finally felt like a capable programmer.

## Current and Future Endeavors

Recently,  I’m developing a Museum Management System using SQL, the .NET Framework, and ADO.NET.

I love analyzing project needs, building database with SQL, designing three-tier architectures, and creating APIs to connect with front-end frameworks like React.js, my favorite. I’m also thinking about learning AngularJS.

## Looking Ahead

I’m eager to join a professional team where I can keep learning, share my knowledge, and help solve problems. I want to be part of a dynamic company that creates advanced solutions and makes a real impact.
